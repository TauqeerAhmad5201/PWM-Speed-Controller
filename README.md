# PWM-Speed-Controller

PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) One method that is often used for DC motor control using a microcontroller is Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) method. The speed of the electric motor depends on the modulator voltage. The greater the voltage, the faster the rotation of an electric motor.
